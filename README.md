# OpenKeyboard for the Xbox360 Chatpad

This repository contains the OpenKeyboard031 sources for the Xbox360 Chatpad's processor (PIC16F883)

These files were obtained while looking through a mailing list archive from 2008. They appear to be the only surviving copy of this project.

The OpenKeyboard031 folder can be found in Ben Heck's video on the video titled "[Build a Retro Computer: BASIC 80's Pocket Computer](https://youtu.be/Hjdj14C_jAI?t=212)"  

I'm currently in the process of hacking my own chatpads and therefore the code here hasn't been tested yet.


Feel free to open an issue if anything comes up
